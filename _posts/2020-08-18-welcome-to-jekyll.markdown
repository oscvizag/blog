## What is discord?

Discord is a messaging and voice-chat service, similar to skype. It offers a lot more functionality ("pinging" users, search through old messages, etc.), has no ads, and is easy to invite people to.

## Why should I join?

You can meet cool members and have casual discussions on programming or other subjects without the clutter and inconvenience of going through other services. And if you join, you are expanding that pool of cool members.

The goal of this discord server is to be minimalist, as reflected in this post, while still allowing for multifaceted discussion and some light fun. For more specifics, feel free to message us on discord.

(This is a permanent invite link. Feel free to send it to anyone you want â€” the more, the merrier!)
